## Tips & Best Practices

### 1. Start with your non-negotiables
Add your wake-up time, meals, and sleep time first. Build your schedule around these anchors.

### 2. Be realistic with time blocks
If a task takes 2 hours, block out 2 hours. The visual feedback helps you see if you're overcommitting.

### 3. Use habits for daily routines
Instead of creating the same task every day, use the Habits feature with "Daily" recurrence.

### 4. Check your weekly view
Sunday night, review your upcoming week. Adjust tasks as needed.

### 5. Follow the system
The power is in consistency. Follow your system even when you don't feel like it.
